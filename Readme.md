# Terraform boilerplate for AWS

This is a **boilerplate** to kickstart a generic infrastructure in AWS.

With this basic setup, it's possible to create a baremetal K8s cluster with a master node and a worker node on EC2 to deploy applications using a postgres database hosted in RDS, recording it's logs (collected by Prometheus, for example) in EFS.

<b>
This project is not intended to be final, every infrastructure will have it's own specifications that must be implemented separately, so it is highly recommended to fork this repository and rename and reorganize the variables and resources to suit your specific needs.

# Todo

The following improvements can be made to this project:

- **Addition of environment variables**: Some names can be removed from this code and transfered to a more flexible structure, such an environment configuration;

- **Automation of ACM allocation and resolution**: It is still necessary to add the necessary records generated by the ACM resource in your DNS Provider;

- **Recover account id from AWS automatically**: Some resources require the account id or a specific user ID, that still need to be added manually;

- **Auto generation of RDS DB password**: The database password is static, so the infrastructure manager needs to set one before applying terraform;

- **Key-pair generation for EC2 instances**: The key-pair must be generated locally for now, and added to the key_pair folder to be used;

- **General cleanup**: Remove useless exports from some resources.
